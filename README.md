An ultra-barebones readability addon for Firefox.

I wrote this out of frustration with overwrought readability tools like BeeLine and Evernote Clearly. They too often remove elements like HTML5 canvases or load slowly, when I usually just want the text to be monochrome and thinner. I've used ZenRead almost exclusively for months, so I thought I should share it.

The current version simply:
* makes all links black
* removes all links' text decoration
* sets the maxWidth of all paragraphs to 40em
* sets the maxWidth of all lists to 40em
